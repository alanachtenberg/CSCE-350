<h3>1. Sum Function [15 points] </h3>
Write a function that takes three integer parameters
(<tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>, and <tt>C</tt>)
and returns a sum of them (<tt>A+B+C</tt>).
Copy <a href='files/Lab4_1_incomplete.s'>Lab4_1_incomplete.s</a>
and complete this program.
Use the parameter passing and call/return sequences
discussed in class for less than four parameters.

Save your code as "Lab4_1.s" and run it in PCSpim.

<h3>2. 2D Matrix Transpose Function [30 points]</h3>
Write a matrix transpose function
that takes one 2D array,
transposes it, and stores the result to another 2D array.
The following C code shows that
<tt>mat_transpose</tt> function
takes <tt>A</tt> as an input parameter
and <tt>T</tt> as an output parameter.
The size of the matrix <tt>A</tt> is specified
as <tt>NUMROWS_A</tt> and <tt>NUMCOLS_A</tt>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
void mat_transpose(int **A, int **T, int NUMROWS_A, int NUMCOLS_A)
{
    int i, j;
    for ( i = 0; i &lt; NUMROWS_A; ++i )
        for ( j = 0; j &lt; NUMCOLS_A; ++j )
            T[j][i] = A[i][j];
    return;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Use the calling/return sequences and parameter passing convention
discussed in class.
Similar discussion on function calls can be found in textbook Appendix A.

<p>
Your MIPS program must have a transpose function
and some codes <u>to print out original and transpose matrices</u>
on the console.

<h4>Storage Organization for 2D Matrix in C</h4>

<p>When the caller function passes a 2D matrix as a parameter in C language,
a double C pointer (<tt>**A</tt>) is used to pass only the address of the matrix.
<tt>A</tt> is the address of an array of pointers.
Element <tt>A[i]</tt> of this array is the address to the row number <tt>i</tt>
of the 2D matrix.
A 2D matrix is represented as a collection of its rows,
with each row just being a one-dimensional array.
We call this type of organization
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_major'>row-major order</a>.
Two pointer dereferences are needed to access
each element in a matrix.
That is, to access A[2][1] (at location (2, 1) of the matrix)
we first dereference pointer A
to indicate the beginning of row number 2 (=A[2]),
and dereference that pointer (A[2]) to the element (A[2][1]).</p>

<h4>Declaration of 2D Matrices in Data Segment</h4>

The following code shows declaration of 4x4 matrices
with initial values in row-major order.
Use this code for testing a transpose function.

<blockquote>
<pre>
.data
.align	2				# Request alignment on word (4 byte) boundary

## 4x4 Matrix Declaration ##
A0:	.word 41, 42, 43, 44		# Declare and initialize 1st Row of A
A1:	.word 55, 56, 57, 58		# Declare and initialize 2nd Row of A
A2:	.word 19, 10, 11, 12		# Declare and initialize 3rd Row of A
A3:	.word 23, 24, 25, 26		# Declare and initialize 4th Row of A
A:	.word A0, A1, A2, A3		# Declare and initialize the pointer to the rows

NUMROWS_A:	.word	4		# the number of rows
NUMCOLS_A:	.word	4		# the number of columns

## 4x4 Matrix Declaration ##
T0:	.word  0,  0,  0,  0		# Declare and initialize 1st Row of T
T1:	.word  0,  0,  0,  0		# Declare and initialize 2nd Row of T
T2:	.word  0,  0,  0,  0		# Declare and initialize 3rd Row of T
T3:	.word  0,  0,  0,  0		# Declare and initialize 4th Row of T
T:	.word T0, T1, T2, T3		# Declare and initialize the pointer to the rows

NUMROWS_T:	.word	4		# the number of rows
NUMCOLS_T:	.word	4		# the number of columns

<p>Array A and T are defined in row-major order in the data segment.
Not that the first dimensional elements of array A and T store addresses of the corresponding one dimensional arrays.
To get the addresses of the second dimensional arrays, we use <tt>lw</tt> instructions, not <tt>la</tt> instruction</p>

<p>This example shows how to access A[i][j].</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
	# Assume i is stored in register $t6 and j in register $t7
	
	la	$t1,	A		# Load address of A into register $t1
	
	sll	$t2,	$t6,	2	# Shift left twice (same as i * 4)
	add	$t2,	$t2,	$t1	# Address of pointer A[i]
	lw	$t3,	($t2)		# Get address of an array A[i] and put it into register $t3
	
	sll	$t4,	$t7,	2	# Shift left twice (same as j * 4)
	add	$t4,	$t3,	$t4	# Address of A[i][j]
	lw	$t0,	($t4)		# Load value of A[i][j]
