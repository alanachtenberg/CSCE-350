<h3>1. Objective</h3>

<p>In this project, you will build a single-cycle
processor, which executes a given subset of the MIPS instruction set. The
processor includes a data-path and a control unit, and is similar to the one
discussed in class. During demonstration of your project
various MIPS test programs will be used for verification of your work. This
project will rely on the behavioral Verilog features
but you are allowed to use structural designs, if desired.</p>

<h3>2. Control Unit Design</h3>

<p>Control unit in the processor controls all components'
behavior, so you should completely understand how the control units work in the
processor. Chapter 5.4 explains this in detail. As described in the <u>Figure
5.24</u> in the textbook (3rd Edition), your processor will have two control units, (1) a main control unit and (2) an
ALU control unit. You are strongly recommended to read the chapter carefully before you attempt to implement something.</p>

<h3>3. Datapath Design</h3>

<p>You should implement all components you need in Verilog. You may use behavioral or any combination of
behavioral and structural Verilog features. All Verilog models should correspond to realistic components,
such as, registers, comparators, shifters, etc. No super-composite components
are allowed. For example, a branch unit that takes in the opcode,
operands, and PC, and outputs a new PC, or something similar to that is not
permitted. You will be given a number of basic datapath
components which you may use or extend. It is not mandatory to use the given
components, but you can use them as examples for designing your own. All
storage elements should be negative-edge triggered.</p>

<h3>3.1 Datapath Components</h3>

<p>There are a few components you will need for your processor,
including the following. You may start by designing these sub-components:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><b>ALU</b>: 32-bit ALU,
<b>Extender</b>: sign/zero extender,
<b>Register File</b> regfile: register file,
<b>Shifter</b>: Arithmetic logical, multi-bit shifting unit,
<b>Instruction Memory</b>: 2K-words deep, 32-bit wide, initial content will be loaded from the Verilog code,
<b>Data Memory</b>: 4K-words deep, 32-bit wide, no initial contents. <u>This part can be implemented in Project 3.</u>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>3.2 Provided Components</h3>

<p>
A number of data-path components are provided
as examples of building larger behavioral constructs in Verilog.
You may use these components.
The following files are available <a href="./files/project2">here</a>
(accessible inside .tamu.edu domain): (If you have a problem to access those file, contact TA.)
</p>

<ul>
 <li>SingleCycleProc.v: A skeleton module for your
     processor. You need to fill in the missing parts of this file to complete
     the processor. Note that the current test module "testCPU" is designed for Project 3.
     You need to change this module to run with the provided
     <a href="files/project2/imeminit_simple_test.v">simple diagnostic program</a>.</li>
 <li>ALU_behav.v: A behavioral implementation of the ALU you
     would need for this project.</li>
 <li>signextend.v: A sign extender.</li>
 <li>lshift2.v: A left-shift-by-two module.</li>
 <li>IdealMemory.v, dmeminit.v, imeminit.v: A behavioral implementation of the ideal
     data and instruction memories, and files to initialize their contents. We
     will provide additional memory contents files later for evaluation and
     test purposes.</li>
 <li>mux.v: Multiplexors of various sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finish the implementation of the processor by supplying or
completing all necessary modules. You may use any Verilog
structural or behavioral language construct.</p>

<h3>4. Component Propagations Delays</h3>

<p>The single data-path must incorporate reasonable propagation
delay amounts for each one of each component. You need to specify propagation
delays for both combinational and sequential circuits. Finally, you have to
find and use the minimum possible clock periods T<sub>CC</sub> in your single
data-paths.</p>

<h3>4.1 Component Propagations Delays (Optional)</h3>

<p>All of your Verilog components
must, in general, incorporate "reasonable" propagation delays. For each
component, think about how that component would be implemented using discrete
gates. Use this mental discrete gate implementation to estimate the delays to
use. There is no exact right or wrong answer for the delays to use. However, if
the delays are too large or too small, you will be asked to justify your decision.
The delay models may be kept simple, i.e., one delay value can be used for an
entire component (which should be the maximum worst-case delay). For the datapath
controller you should use a delay of 20&#916;T.
You may use the following normalized delays for individual gates:</p>

<table align="center" border="1">
<tbody><tr>
	<th align="center">Gate</th><th align="center">Delay in &#916;T</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">NOT</td><td align="center">1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">NOR</td><td align="center">2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">NAND</td><td align="center">1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">OR</td><td align="center">3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">AND</td><td align="center">3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">XOR</td><td align="center">2</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Please look through the Verilog
code of the provided components for examples of how to specify propagation
delays for the various components and how to support edge-triggered clocking.
You should try to use reasonable delays for the blocks with storage elements.</p>

<h3>4.2 Resetting and Initializing the Data-paths</h3>

<p>Your data-paths must employ an active-low,
master reset signal, called Reset_L. This signal should be kept at the
de-asserted level at all times, except when the processor is being reset. To
reset the processor, drive Reset_L low for at least 10 integral clock cycles
TCC and then reset Reset_L to high level. The master
reset should feed into all reset types of signals of the datapath,
such as those of the register file. You have to
provide a unit that is external to the main control units that contain at least
one register called IPC. This register supplies the first Program Counter (PC)
that your processor should execute after "reset" IPC and all other input
control signals should be driven by the top level test module of your model.</p>

<h3>5. Verilog Controller for the Datapath</h3>

<h3>5.1 Complete Control Unit truth table</h3>

<p>Make two complete truth tables considering all Instructions
shown in Table 1; One for the main control unit and
the other for the ALU control unit. Your table should be similar to Figure 5.18
in the textbook (3rd Edition). An Excel file is recommended because the table can be big.</p>

<h3>5.2 Construct Control Units</h3>

<p>Build the Control Unit (CU) for the single-cycle datapath of Section 6. You may 
use any behavioral Verilog instruction available to develop the CU. This CU
should take the exact bits from the 32-bit instruction and generate the control
signals. You must add any control signals necessary to read instructions of the
instruction memory, and the "next instruction logic" to generate the Program
Counter (PC) of the instruction which needs to be fetched next.</p>

<p>You may use any behavioral Verilog
statement available to develop the CU. The Verilog
code that specifies the behavior of your CU must be as much structured and
clearly written as possible. Use the Verilog <tt>`define SYMBOL code_to_substitute</tt>
as much as possible and specify upper bounds for units as <tt>parameter n = ....</tt>
Note: Recall that in the Single-Cycle Processor, everything should take place
in one clock cycle T<sub>CC</sub>.</p>

<h3>6. Basic Single-Cycle Data-Path</h3>

<p>Develop an implementation in Verilog
of a basic single-cycle processor (SCP) supporting the following instructions.</p>

<table align="center" border="1">
<tbody><tr>
	<th align="center">Type</th><th align="center">Instructions</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">Arithmetic (unsigned)</td><td align="center">addu, subu, addiu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">Arithmetic (signed)</td><td align="center">add, sub, addi</td>
</tr>
<!--tr>
	<td align="center">Logical</td><td align="center">and, andi, or, ori, xor, xori</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">Shift</td><td align="center">sll, sra, srl</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">Compare</td><td align="center">slt, slti, sltu, sltiu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">Control</td><td align="center">beq, bne, blez, bltz, j, jr, jal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center">Data transfer</td><td align="center">lw, sw, lui, lb, sb</td>
</tr-->
</tbody></table>

<p>Use the actual MIPS machine language instruction formats,
given in the back cover of your textbook.</p>

<h3>6.1 Implementation Step 1: Program Counter (PC)</h3>

<p>The first in this project is building PC register which holds the address of the current instruction. 
Do not use <tt>startPC</tt> signal as PC, which is an input of the module <tt>SingleCycleProc</tt>, or do not attempt to modify startPC inside the module.
The signal <tt>startPC</tt> is used to provide the starting address of a new program during a reset.
You need to assign a new register named PC and then, copy <tt>startPC</tt> to PC when <tt>Reset_L</tt> is activated (low) or rising (positive edge).
As the clock goes on, PC increases by 4 when <tt>Reset_L</tt> is not activated.</p><p>

</p><h3>6.2 Implementation Step 2: Reading an Instruction (Fetch)</h3>

<p>Once PC is determined, you can get an instruction from Instruction Memory module named <tt>InstrMem</tt>. 
After fetching an instruction, store it into a new register <tt>IR</tt>.
Before connecting this module, check whether the correct program file is included in <tt>IdealMemory.v</tt>. 
In this project, we will use <a href="files/project2/imeminit_simple_test.v">imeminit_simple_test.v</a>.
If you get an instruction, check the value in each region in the format using <tt>$display("rs = ... rd = ... rt = ... imm16 = ... func = ...");</tt>.
Each component must be fed into the register module, the main control module, and other modules as shown in Figure 5.24 in the textbook (3rd Edition) page 314.</p><p>

</p><h3>6.3 Implementation Step 3: Building a Register file</h3>

<p>MIPS architecture has a register file containing 32 32-bit registers. 
Each register is read using one of two read register ports and written with one write register port. 
Register write is enabled only when RegWrite signal is on.</p>

<h3>6.4 Implementation Step 4: Building Control Units</h3>

<p>The behavior of the processor is controlled by controllers.
There are two control units in MIPS architecture.
One is general controller controling MUXes, the register file, and the memory. The other is ALU controller controlling ALU.
Since the operation is determined by the instruction, these controllers need information from the instruction.</p>


<h3>7. Testing and Diagnostic Programs</h3>

<p>We will provide you with <a href="files/project2/imeminit_simple_test.v">a simple diagnostic program</a> to test
your datapath and control units. You need to run the
program using your processor and display the all internal states of a module by
using appropriately coded <tt>$display("...");</tt>
statements from within the module. For instance, you can use <tt>$display("Reg[rt] = %b ...", Reg[rt]);</tt>
statements in a module to print on the STDOUT the
contents of a register <tt>rt</tt> You would better have a neat
display to make your life easier when you have to debug a more complicated
processor.</p>
