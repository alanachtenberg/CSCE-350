<h3>1. C <tt>strlen()</tt> Function [20 points]</h3>

<p>The string function, <tt>size_t strlen(const char *s)</tt>
(found in the standard C library) counts and
returns the size in bytes of its argument string <tt>s</tt>,
not including a terminating null character.</p>

<p>Translate this C function, <tt>strlen()</tt> shown below,
into a MIPS assembly function. Copy <a href="files/Lab5_1_incomplete.s">Lab5_1_incomple.s</a> and complete this program.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
int strlen(const char *str)
{
    int i;
    for ( i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; i++ )
        ; /* Nothing. Just count the numbers until the terminating null character */

    return ( i );
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>A character in a string can be read using <tt>lb</tt> (load byte) instruction. 
The format of the instruction is exactly same as that of <tt>lw</tt> instruction except the size of the unit of reading.</p>

<p>This example shows how to access str[i].</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
	# Assume i is stored in register $t6 and the address of the string is stored $a0
	
	add	$t0,	$a0,	$t6	# The size of a character in a string is 1 byte
	lb	$t1,	($t0)		# Read a character at str[i]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that "read string" system call returns a string containing '\n' at the end of the string. 
Thus, '\n' is also counted in strlen().</p>

<p>Save your code as "Lab5_1.s" and run it in PCSpim.</p>

Show your solution to TA and demonstrate
program execution in SPIM.</p>

<h3>2. C <tt>atoi()</tt> Function [30 points]</h3>
<p>Write an <tt>atoi()</tt> function in MIPS, which convert a string into an integer.
This function is one of basic functions in the standard C library.
This function returns an integer of the string represented in decimal.</p>

<p>The specification is: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
int atoi (const char * str);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If the string contains other than digits, it returns the converted value of the substring from the beginning which contains digits only.
For example, <tt>atoi("49ers")</tt> returns 49 and <tt>atoi("nothing?")</tt> returns 0. 
Note that '0' is equal to 48 and '9' is 57. 
Assume we enter non-negative numbers only.</p>

<p>The program receives a string from keyboard input, pass it to atoi() function,
and prints the return value from the function on the console.</p>

<p>Save your code as "Lab5_2.s" and run it in PCSpim.</p>

<h3>3. String Reverse Function [30 points]</h3>

<p>Write a string reverse function that takes a string as a parameter
and reverses it.
The function need not return a reversed string
if it stores the result to the address of the parameter.
You might need strlen() function to compute the length of a string.</p>

<p>The program receives a string from keyboard input,
reverses it by calling a function, and prints the reversed string on the console.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Input a string: cobbler
Reversed string: relbboc
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Save your code as "Lab5_3.s" and run it in PCSpim.</p>

<p><span style='color:red'>Check-off Requirement:</span>
Show your solution to TA and demonstrate
program execution in SPIM.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Submission Requirement</b></p>

Turn in three source files (<tt>Lab5_1.s, Lab5_2.s, and Lab5_3.s</tt>).
