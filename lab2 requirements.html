<h3>1. A simple MIPS program [25 points]</h3>

Write a MIPS program that takes a value in <tt>$s1</tt>
and stores a value as "<tt>2^i * $s1</tt>" into each of eight registers <tt>$ti</tt>
(<tt>0 &lt= i &lt= 7</tt>).
For example, if <tt>$s1</tt> is <tt>3</tt>,
registers <tt>$t0</tt> through <tt>$t7</tt> will have the following values:

<blockquote>
<pre>
$t0 = 3 (3*2^0)
$t1 = 6 (3*2^1)
$t2 = 12 (3*2^2)

...

$t7 = 384 (3*2^7)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Hint: You don't need to use any multiplcation operation. It can be implemented only with "add" operation.

<p>
At the top of your program, put <tt>main:</tt> (the word "main" followed by a colon).
"<tt>main:</tt>" is a MIPS assembly language <i>label</i>.
This label tells SPIM assembler the starting point of the program.
You can put the label in column 1, to the left of the first instruction, or on a separate line.
</p>

<p>
At the end of your program, add the following two instructions to
notify the Operating System to regain control when the program execution is done.
<blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'>
<pre>
	addi	$v0,	$0,	10	# Move "exit" system function code to argument reg
	syscall				# Request the OS to carry out the program exit
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

Save your code as "Lab2_1.s" and load it into SPIM using "File-&gt;Open". Before you run the program,
set register <tt>$s1</tt> to some value using "Simulator-&gt;Set value...".
Then run the program using "Simulator-&gt;Go".
If the program does not have any syntax error,
the message "successfully loaded" will appear in the "Messages" window when you load the program.
Run your program and examine the register values.

<p>
For this part you may want to check the register values in decimal
rather than hexadecimal format.
Under the "Simulator-&gt;Settings" menu option,
uncheck &quot;General registers in hexadecimal&quot;,
if the registers don't show values in decimal format.

<h3>2. Translation from C to MIPS [30 points]</h3>

<p>Convert the following 
C program into a MIPS program:</p>

<blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'>
<pre>
int B[4] = { 300, 200, 100, 0 };
int i = 3;
void main ( void )
{
    B[i] = B[0] + B[1] + B[2];
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This program has
two variables, an integer array <tt>B</tt> and an integer <tt>i</tt>.
It adds the first three array elements together and stores the result
in the last element. To get started, use the following code.</p>

<blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'>
<pre>
.data 0x10008000			# data segment start (assembler directive)
B:	.word 300			# B[0]
	.word 200			# B[1]
	.word 100			# B[2]
	.word 0				# B[3]
i:	.word 3
.text 					# code segment start (assembler directive)
main:	la	$t1,	B		# load the address of B[0] (&(B[0]) == B) into register $t1
	lw	$t0,	0($t1)		# load value of B[0] into register $t0
	##
	## COMPLETE HERE. ##
	##
	addi	$v0,	$0,	10	# `exit MIPS program' syscall
	syscall
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This code gives you a partial solution to the problem.
Your task is to complete the program by adding the missing MIPS instructions.
Recall that in MIPS large data structures like arrays are stored in a memory,
not in the registers.
To move data from the memory to the register,
use the "load word" instruction (<tt>lw</tt>).
In the above program, "<tt>lw $t0, 0($t1)</tt>" loads
the first array element (B[0]) to the register <tt>$t0</tt>.
The format of <tt>lw</tt> is "<tt>lw $rt, offset_16bit($rs)</tt>",
where <tt>$rt</tt> is a register to receive data and
<tt>offset_16bit($rs)</tt> has an <i>effective address (EA)</i>
(the address of the word in the memory to be fetched) for data.
In MIPS, EA is determined by base register and offset.
Base register (<tt>$rs</tt>) has a "base address" of the memory.
Offset (<tt>offset_16bit</tt>) has a 16-bit signed integer.
</p>

<p>
Here, let's see how to get EA of the first element (<tt>B[0]</tt>) in array <tt>B</tt>.
In C, you can get EA by using <tt>*B[0]</tt> or simply referring to <tt>B</tt>,
the array name without a subscript.
In MIPS, we use "load address" <i>pseudo-instruction</i>, <tt>la</tt>.
In the above program, the instruction after the label <tt>main:</tt>,
"<tt>la $t1, B</tt>", shows a pseudo-instruction example.
It makes the SPIM assembler load the memory address of <tt>B</tt> into register <tt>$t1</tt>.
Then the next instruction "<tt>lw $t0, 0($t1)</tt>" fetches
a word from memory at location "<tt>$t1 + 0</tt>".
Complete the program for loading the second and third elements of array <tt>B</tt>
to registers, summing up three values, and store the sum in the forth element of array <tt>B</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Save your code as "Lab2_2.s" and run it in PCSpim.

<p><b>Notes</b>
<ul>
  <li><tt>.data</tt> and <tt>.text</tt> are <i>assembler directives</i>.
  They specify which part of the memory will be used for data or instructions 
  during run-time. 
  Other assembler directives can be found <a href="../reference/assembler_dir.html">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Each element of the array is offset by four bytes, because MIPS uses four
  bytes (one word) to store an integer. MIPS memory uses <i>byte addressing</i>.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>3. Console input [10 points]</h3>

<p>
Write a MIPS program to get user input from keyboard and
store value you enter to <tt>$s0</tt> register.
This program will print a prompt message on the PCSpim console window,
and then wait for user input.
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 1:</b>
As shown in Part 2, add <tt>.data</tt> and <tt>.text</tt> assembler directives to your program.
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 2:</b>
Define a prompt message in data segment.

<blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'>
<pre>
mesg: .asciiz "Enter the value for register s1:"
</pre>
</blockquote>

The assembler directive <tt>.asciiz</tt>
says that a type of the <tt>mesg</tt> variable is
a null-terminated string (exactly the same as in C language).
The string value is enclosed by quotes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 3:</b>
Add the following codes in text segment to print the message on console.

<blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'>
<pre>
la	$a0,	mesg		# Load effective address(mesg) to $a0
addi	$v0,	$0,	4	# Load constant 4 to reg v0
syscall				# Switch into the "kernel" to print 'mesg' out
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

Take a look at explanation about these three instructions.
<ol>
<li>"<tt>la $a0, mesg</tt>" loads the memory address of
the string variable <tt>mesg</tt> into register <tt>$a0</tt>.</li>
<li>"<tt>addi $v0, $0, 4</tt>" loads a constant <tt>4</tt> into register <tt>$v0</tt>.
<tt>4</tt> is used for Operating System to perform the "print string" operation.
This instruction literally means "store the result of <tt>$0+4</tt> into register <tt>$v0</tt>".
Because register <tt>$0</tt> has a constant <tt>0</tt>,
the result of this instruction is to copy the immediate constant 4 to register <tt>$v0</tt>.</li>
<li> "<tt>syscall</tt>" instruction invokes operating system
to perform a task on behalf of the calling program,
in this case, to print a string on the console.
syscall is used when a system procedure call is required.
Arguments for the procedure are passed by two registers, <tt>$a0</tt> and <tt>$v0</tt>.
After a system procedure is finished, OS forwards control to the user program.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 4:</b>
Add the following codes to get keyboard input from a user.

<blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'>
<pre>
addi	$v0,	$0,	5	# reg v0 = 5
syscall
</pre>
</blockquote>

Take a look at explanation about these two instructions.
<ol>
<li>"<tt>addi $v0, $0, 5</tt>" loads the constant value <tt>5</tt>
in to register <tt>$v0</tt>.
System call <tt>5</tt> is used for "input number" operation.</li>
<li>When "<tt>syscall</tt>" is executed with <tt>$v0</tt>=5,
your program will allow a user to input a number from a keyboard.
The input number is stored to register <tt>$v0</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Since we are using "exit" system call at the end of the program, 
put those instructions after "read integer" system call to copy the value to $s0.

<pre>
	add	$s0,	$v0,	$0
</pre>

<p>
Save your code as "Lab2_3.s" and run it in PCSpim.
